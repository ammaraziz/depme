# depsme
Tool to detect automatically test workflow dependencies.

### Why

I wrote this tool to automatically test dependencies from Conda, Pip, Rlang without having to remember specific enchantation for each tool.

### How

depsme can dependencies parse from the terminal:

```
pass
```

from a generic text file (one dependency per line):

```
pass
```

from conda.yaml:

```
pass
```

As a module inside python script (eg in a snakemake pipeline):

```
pass
```


It can pretty print the results to help end users:

```
pass
```

It can output to text file:

```
pass
```

### Install

You can pip install this tool (no dependencies!):

```
pass
```

Or pull the single python file (no dependencies!) directly from github:

```
pass
```
